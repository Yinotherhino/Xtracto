    <h2> About Xtracto </h2>
      <p>
        Xtracto is an easy-to-use software that collects, displays, and allows
        users to edit the metadata of different uploaded files, helping them
        manage their digital assets better. From images, PDFs, CSV, and JSON
        file types, the platform also goes beyond metadata extraction to enable
        users to convert file types, and resize content to fit their
        requirements.
      </p>
      <h2>How To Use</h2>
      <p>
        To use Xtracto, simply, register and upload the file you want to extract
        metadata from and  then wait for the extraction process to be done.
